        <p>Porter ties his experience with gaming to everyday life, making insightful connections between play and inclusion. Here are some excerpts from a conversation with Porter to guide our exploration of the second element in the cycle of exclusion: <em>who makes it.</em></p>

<h3>Why did you build a Wall of Exclusion?</h3>
<p>I keep these here to remind me of all the assumptions that we, as designers, make about people. The design of these products clearly signals that gaming is for some people, and not for others. A game controller says "This is for you" or "This is not for you." This is true for everything we design. We make assumptions about who our users are, and we design for those assumptions. And if you don't fit those assumptions, then you are excluded.</p>

<h3>What happens when designers make assumptions about people?</h3>

<p>All of these games are based on a broad assumption that you’ll be using your fingers and your hands to interact. And for me that is almost entirely moot. I have some physical mobility that I can use to move my wheelchair, but everything I do in the digital realm is mediated through other avenues of interaction, primarily speech. Whenever I’m using technology I use speech to control it even though it was never designed to work for speech. It’s not just that a game isn’t optimized for my abilities. It was made without ever even considering the possibility that someone would need to interact with it in the ways that I do. That places the onus on me to figure out all these workarounds. For gamers with disabilities, we have to spend as much time figuring out how to play a game as we do actually playing.</p>

<h3>How does a designer make something inclusive? </h3>
<p>Games that only allow a user to play in one way, that have a very prescriptive notion of who a player is, those tend to be the ones that are the least accessible. But games that allow more freedom and flexibility tend to be a lot more inclusive. I often like to point out World of Warcraft as one of the really great inclusive games. There are players who don’t have the motor ability to interact fast enough to engage in combat. But I know people with disabilities who have played this game for years. They have all of their crafting skills maxed out because for them, the game isn’t about doing quests. The game is economics. The game is building a leather- working empire and making gear that people can buy from them. And I don’t know if anyone at Blizzard Entertainment would say that they envisioned that as a viable play style. But nevertheless, they built an inclusive system. </p>

<h3>What’s the role of gaming in your life?</h3>
<p>I still remember the day that my uncle Mike came over to give me Final Fantasy VII as a 12th birthday present. It was my favorite game, despite the fact that I’d never played it. I’d watched him play it, but was never able to join in. I was able to play games until I lost the ability to use game controllers around the age of 10. For me, gaming was becoming a spectator sport. My uncle once spent an entire afternoon trying to tape little pieces of wood onto his controller to make it work for me. When the efforts were unsuccessful, I told him not to worry about it. Final Fantasy just wasn’t for me. “Sure it is,” he reassured me as he picked up the modified controller, “we just need to stop this thing from getting in the way.” I don’t just play. I work to figure out how to play. It’s figuring out how to participate in societal moments. Which is a burden sometimes. I think of it as a metagame that I play in all areas of my life. It’s a puzzle to be solved and shared.</p>

<h3>How is gaming shifting from exclusion to inclusion?</h3>
<p>There is a natural inclination to use yourself as a shortcut to make assumptions about the people that you’re designing for. And I think that’s especially rampant in the world of game design. Historically, the industry has been incredibly homogenous. Games have been created by people who feel like they are never going to be different than they are in that moment. Many of them feel like they are the only users who really need to be considered. And that’s changing, which is good. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the increasing diversity amongst game designers is happening concurrently with the release of more inclusive games. I think those two things go together.</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3> 

<p>The reading provides a frank and interesting perspective in inclusive design, it addresses what i believe one of the most important questions that we as designers’ ask ourselves how do we create solutions and experiences that are accessible by all the different types of people that exist in society?Thereading highlighted how innovation in design and particularly inclusivity in design can come from not reinventing the wheel but simply in exploring a different way the wheel can be used. In digital experiences it is often easy to exclude sections of the target audience simply because of their disabilities. Simply put it is easy approach design as we have always done where we know the screens we are designing for so we do not consider the way that that screen is being used.</p> 
    
    <p>I so often as a designer, fall into the hole of designing for myself thinking that because of my perspective of a south asian "minority" covers many perspecectives that are oftenneglected it is easy to ignore other perspectives, so diverse perspectives are imperative when designing for humans. Additionally it should not be a limitation to be restricted to a certain individuals simply because the technology used to access it. Similar to in John Porter’s Life there are always workaround solutions that we as designers can emply to make something have better functionality for our users.</p> 

<p>    However the part of the story that was additionally striking was the story of Carpenter’s uncle attempting to modify game controllers for him, the burden of design and modification should never fall on the users, it should fall on us as designers to create the workarounds and reinventions, that is the true meaning of inclusive innovation when we as designers decide to create we must consider all who use our creations not just those that look like us. And hen we really think about it we all have our own walls of exclusion the walls that tell us no or that we can’t be somewhere or can’t do something so its even more important to raise those voices that are not heard as often. </p>
