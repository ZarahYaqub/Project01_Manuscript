### Reading 
[Mismatch: How Inclusion Shapes Design](https://www.amazon.com/Mismatch-Inclusion-Simplicity-Technology-Business/dp/0262038889/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=PT6KC6YHXYCH&keywords=mismatched+kat+holmes&qid=1558021593&s=gateway&sprefix=mismatched+ka,aps,128&sr=8-2-fkmrnull&linkCode=sl1&tag=jarrettfuller-20&linkId=943c432127228f8a462b9271aff2027d&language=en_US)
By [Kat Holmes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katholmes/)

The reading follows Kat Holmes as she discovers and shares the secrets and conversations around inclusion in design. This section in particular discusses ways in which inclusivity in design can be improved simply by bringing in diverse perspectives in the design process.

### Semantic Dom
nesting! You can have more than one tag on a piece of text. Imagine how the text will be read, beyond just its layout. What parts do you want to emphasise, to pull out to the reader? Think of it similarly to reading a news article online.

### Stylesd Markup 
Don't get too attached to your initial design, as it may not translate well; be open to changes 

### Spacing and Refinement
whitepace!!
